# Rustomrides
As a traveller from Bangalore with great admiration for nature, I aim to spill the sweet revelations to the world and unravel the existence of Mother Nature in the form of magnificent landscapes, rivers, hills, mountains and beaches to weave into something that could only be taken with complete stagger. The unexplored, remote, wild and exotic is what drives my passion to bring the best beauty out. Love for the machine (Himalayan- 2019) as a youth has made my travel discoveries possible with utter amusement and adventure. After serving as the Digital Marketing faculty head for many top-rated B-schools in India, I have given my passion a full-time position as a moto vlogger, rider, and photographer.
